#  Janke Learning

Let's create the biggest, baddest collection of open resources for teaching the foundations of computing literacy in JavaScript.  Lesson plans, teaching tips, study tools, exercises, projects, course outlines. Everything you need to start your own study group, teach yourself, or bring your existing class up a notch.  All of it grounded in the latest findings from research in Computing Education. 

This won't be: the next fullstack tutorial, a new learning platform, tutorials for the latest frameworks & tooling, or single path for going from 0 to hero.

We want to enable you to teach your course, for your people, in your way, by providing resources in a flexible and adaptable format.  Simply fork the repos that fit your class, adapt them, and have your students work from your fork!
   
Do you know a great resource we're missing? Or have an idea how this project could be better?  Send us an email or a Pull Request, contributions are always welcome

## JavaScript

_JS In Order_ lays out a path to learn JavaScript in order focusing on _language mechanisms_ & _CS principles_ instead of _language features_ & _use cases_, incrementally building your [JS notional machine](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-notional-machine) one step at a time.

## Code Skills

Being comfortable manipulating, deciphering, and testing code is tricky to learn and a separate skill from writing algorithms or learning a programming language.  These exercises cover the core skills you'll need to comfortable work with JavaScript.

__Code Skills__
* [annotations]() - coming soon
* [tracing execution paths](https://github.com/janke-learning/execution-paths)
* [logging program state](https://github.com/janke-learning/trace-and-log)
* [writing test cases](https://github.com/janke-learning/test-cases)
* [expanding code](https://github.com/janke-learning/expanding)
* [asserting single lines](https://github.com/janke-learning/trace-and-assert)

## Strategy

Programming is all about breaking larger problems into smaller ones.  But once you've got a bunch of smaller challenges, what's next?  This section takes a look at how you can identify and apply the right strategy to the right problems.

__Strategy__
* [the roles of variables]() - coming soon
* [types of state problems]() - coming soon
* [factoring in]() - coming soon
* [chunking]() - coming soon
* [factoring out]() - coming soon
* [analyzing strategies]() - coming soon
* recursion: [what is it?](https://github.com/janke-learning/recursion), [planning recursion](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019/blob/master/2-process-over-product.md)
* [conditionals & booleans]() - coming soon
* [iteration]() - coming soon
* [problem-space embedding]() - coming soon

## Solution Design

Learn how to go from a blank page and open-ended challenge, to a clean and working solution. Along the way you'll learn how to study and understand existing code, progressively develop your solutions, and refactor your code into clear and reusable sub-solutions.

__solution design__
* [analyze]() - coming soon
* [remix]() - coming soon
* [work it]() - coming soon
* [embed it]() - coming soon

[TOP](#janke-learning)

## Data Modeling

If Solution Design is about answering questions, Data Modeling is about asking them.

## Theory in Practice

See how coding, programming languages, and software development are actually real-world examples of Computer Science theory. Learning to think of everyday tasks as extensions of CS theory is a productive and approachable way to begin learning about CS, and to improve you coding at the same time

__theory in practice__
* [sets & maps]() - coming soon
* [comparadigms](https://github.com/janke-learning/comparadigms)
* [recursion](https://github.com/janke-learning/recursion) 
* [boolean algebra](https://github.com/janke-learning/boolean-algebra) 
* [simplifying boolean expressions](https://github.com/janke-learning/simplifying-boolean-expressions)
* [free variables]() - coming soon

## Consoliteracy

Before running loose in the DOM & frameworks, take some time to master the DevTools and learn to look at your apps from the inside and the outside.   

__consoliterate projects__
* [stateless](https://github.com/janke-learning/stateless-demo-project) 
* [statefull](https://github.com/janke-learning/statefull-project-demo)

__embedded resources__

## Separation of Concerns

The first step to collaborative & incremental development, and maintainable applications, is the ability to break your code into single-purpose chunks that take care of one clear task.

## Dependency Injection

In Separation of Concerns, you learned how to break down projects into focused & reusable chunks.  In Dependency Injection you'll learn how to build modular, maintainable applications by piecing together different chunks.

__dependency injection__

## Frontend Frameworks

Explore Frontend Frameworks using a variation of [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp) by [jorgebucaran](https://github.com/jorgebucaran) modified to help you prepare for popular frontend frameworks like Vue, React and Angular.   Hyperapp is a minimal frontend framework that illustrates the key principles of larger frontend frameworks without the complexity and build environment.

* [hyperapp starter repo](https://github.com/janke-learning/hyperapp-starter-basic)
