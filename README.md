introduce the 
  nm as procedural-first
  solution design as functional-first
    expansions, sets & mapping, proof-cases
  applied computing as procedural
    demo-projects calling on logic from handlers
  program structure as oop (mvclh)
  software/framework design as functional

* [#parsonizer](https://github.com/janke-learning/parsonizer)
* flow control visualization: [bogdon](https://bogdan-lyashenko.github.io/js-code-to-svg-flowchart/docs/live-editor/index.html), [code2flow](https://code2flow.com/app)  
* [abstract sytax tree explorer](https://astexplorer.net)
* diagramming execution by hand:
    * see notes from august course
    * repoize it with instructions & examples
    * maybe some videos 
    * definately some over-lay or step-by-step diagrams
